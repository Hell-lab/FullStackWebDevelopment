# Project Dashboard

## Idea:
The StV needs a new project dashboard. We basically want to make the old system a bit more usable: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zDA9RtYCeS_W9kqg-fvT_ZM88MHDR_vEhD6qcAP12aM

There are many areas where additional pages might be used (e.g. login, add project, view project details etc.). If none of them work out, we might add a team page. Similarly, endpoints listed below will be extended as the project matures.

## Registration: 
Yes, only registered users can add projects (but unregistered ones can read them).
Potentially even additional permission perimeters (admin access, Ã–H access, guest view)

## Interactions: 

### Essential: 
View all projects (GET), View filtered / sorted projects (GET), Add a project (POST), Update a project (especially project status, PUT), Delete a project (DELETE).
### Optional: 
View project status history (i.e. who updated it, what was a previous status..., GET), View team members (GET), Add new team members (POST), Update team members (PUT), Remove team members (DELETE) 

## Bi-directional communication:
Updates to projects are live and should happen without reload.
