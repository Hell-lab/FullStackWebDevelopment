# Project Dashboard

## Idea:
The StV needs a new project dashboard. We basically want to make the old system a bit more usable: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zDA9RtYCeS_W9kqg-fvT_ZM88MHDR_vEhD6qcAP12aM

## Registration: 
Yes, only registered users can add projects (but unregistered ones can read them).
Potentially even additional permission perimeters (admin access, Ã–H access, guest view)

## Interactions: 

### Essential: 
View all projects, View filtered / sorted projects, Add a project, Update a project (especially project status), Delete a project.
### Optional: 
View project status history (i.e. who updated it, what was a previous status...) 

## Bi-directional communication:
Updates to projects are live and should happen without reload.
